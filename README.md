# Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 1000m can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/Cucumber course.

## Get the code

    git clone https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.js.git
    cd shouty.js

Or simply [download](https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.js/archive/master.zip) a zip file.

## Install Cucumber and other dependencies

    npm install

After this, Cucumber is in `./node_modules/.bin/cucumber.js`
For convenience you can run it with `./cucumber`.

## Run all the tests

    npm test
    
If you see two tests failing, you're good to go.
